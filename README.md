## Open issues & tweaks:

* ~~// TODO: check if there's a bug in NFT owner (profile page -> You are the owner of this NFT)~~
* // TODO: finish Royalties Fees implementation (contract OK / frontend still pending excecute Fee)
* // TODO: navbar shows "Connected" button when is not connected
* // TODO: Change default metadata and image name when upload to PINATA
* // TODO: implement "Decaying Royalties": this could be time based, ownership based or any other variants as sales reduce the number of times a NFT changes hands
